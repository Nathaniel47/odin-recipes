    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>One-Pot Spaghetti is a quick, flavorful, and hassle-free meal where pasta, sauce, and seasonings all cook together in a single pot. The spaghetti absorbs the rich flavors of tomatoes, herbs, and spices as it simmers, creating a hearty dish with tender pasta and a savory sauce. </p>

    <p>Since everything is made in one pot, it not only saves time but also minimizes cleanup — making it perfect for busy weeknights, family dinners, or a comforting meal that feels homemade without extra effort. It takes approximately an hour and 15 minutes to prepare.</p>
